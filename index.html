    <h3>Here are the animals we have available for adoption:</h3>
    <div class="column">
      <h4>Aurum</h4>
      <img src="img/Aurum.jpg" alt="Aurum, our gold dust day gecko.">
      <p>Aurum is a gold dust day gecko. He is 5 inches long and 3 years old. For gold dust day geckos, it is best if you do not try to handle them, as they are rather nervous and easily lose their tails. You will need a vivarium of at least 10 gallons. Put live plants with plenty of leaves in. Small crickets are their main meal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <h4>Callisto</h4>

      <h4>Leo</h4>
      <img src="img/Leo.jpg" alt="Leo, our crested gecko.">
      <p>Leo is a male crested gecko. He should not be handled too often, and be careful because crested geckos do not grow their tails back.</p>
